# Creating your first form

Within your server's management dashboard you'll see an area called "Create a new form". Simply enter what you wish to call your form and you'll be redirected to the editor.

Here you are able to set a description, change the URL slug, and manage other aspects of the form. You're able to easily share the form from the management dashboard, or within the editor under "Form Details".

### Page Index

* **Form Details**\
  Here you're able to modify crucial information about your form. From the description, to how you want the form to be sent in discord.
* **Questions**\
  Where you can create, modify, and remove questions.

## Adding questions

You are able to select from the following question types:

* Short Paragraph (up to 500 characters)
* Long Paragraph (up to 4,000 characters)
* Date (using a calendar selection tool)
* Dropdown (single-choice questions)
* Number
* Email Address
* and Display text

You are able to set configurable settings such as:

* Whether the question is **required**, or can be skipped,
* Where the question is positioned (with the drag and drop editor - arrows on mobile due to space limitations)
* Use discord markdown in display text.

Here's what a form may look like:
