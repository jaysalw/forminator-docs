# Managing Submissions

{% hint style="info" %}
Each form has its own submission page. You're able to view submissions for a specific form by heading to your server's management dashboard, then scrolling down to the list of forms.
{% endhint %}

The submissions manager lets you:

* **Export submissions to**\
  PDFs, CSVs, and JSON files.
* Delete forms in bulk, or one at a time
* View analytics and graphs based on your submissions
* View a total number of submissions, and how much storage it takes up on our servers.

When viewing a submission, you have a few aspects available to you:

* Delete the form, or head back to the previous page you were on,
* View the form's description **and** information about the user who submitted the form.

**If you do not have ADMIN permissions, or are the server owner, you may not be able to delete a submission, or view them.** Please ensure someone with administrator permissions has set up permissions correctly.
