You must have done the following before continuing to other steps:

* Have the bot in your server,
* The bot must have the minimum permissions.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you remove the default permissions when inviting the bot, then some features may not function as intended.\
\
**Ensure the bot can view channels where you wish to send submissions using the default submission notifier option.** (non-webhooks)
{% endhint %}

If you still need to invite the bot, head to [https://top.gg/bot/1414363169761132676](https://top.gg/bot/1414363169761132676) and press "Invite Bot".
