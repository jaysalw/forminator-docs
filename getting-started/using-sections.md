# Using Sections

Sections are multi-page forms which let you organise your forms and provide forms in a more professional way. This is very useful for staff applications, or other such forms.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Sections are not enabled by default.**\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

You are required to enable sections in the "Form Details" tab.
{% endhint %}

If you have already started creating your form before enabling sections, no worries! Your data will be transferred into the Sections format. However this is a one-way action. Be sure you want to change styles as when you change back most data will be lost. (**We are working on a way to change back and forth at will**).

In the above image, you can see the components within the sections editor.&#x20;

1. Add a new section with this button.
2. Add a new question with this button.
3. Move the section UP or DOWN. This will change what page it is on.
4. Delete a button (this will also delete any questions inside of it)
5. Your section's title.
6. Your section's description - you are able to use Discord Markdown here.
7. Your questions.

If not all of the **required fields/questions** in a section have been completed, the user will not be allowed to progress to either the next section, or submitting the form.
