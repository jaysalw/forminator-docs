# Configuring

Your server has it's own page of sorts. This is accessible via your vanity URL. Every server has a vanity URL and is unique, however only premium servers are able to customise it.

For example - by default your vanity URL will be your server's ID.

```
https://forminator.gg/{vanity}
```

If you have a premium server you can change this within your settings page. To edit your settings, head to:

```
https://forminator.gg/{vanity}/settings
```

{% hint style="info" %}
When **forminator** joins a server, it automatically sends a welcome message within the server. You are able to find this link there - or run /info to get it again (or an updated version if you have changed your vanity).
{% endhint %}
