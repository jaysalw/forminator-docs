# Configuring

Your server has it's own page of sorts. This is accessible via your vanity URL. Every server has a vanity URL and is unique, however only premium servers are able to customise it.

For example - by default your vanity URL will be your server's ID.

```
https://forminator.gg/{vanity}
```

If you have a premium server you can change this within your settings page. To edit your settings, head to:

```
https://forminator.gg/{vanity}/manage/settings
```

{% hint style="info" %}
When **forminator** joins a server, it automatically sends a welcome message within the server. You are able to find this link there - or run /info to get it again (or an updated version if you have changed your vanity).
{% endhint %}

### Navigating the management page

The above image is an example of what the management system looks like. This is where you can change almost every aspect of your server's configuration.

This will look different depending on the **permissions** you set for other users through their roles in the permissions tab.

**Every-day users do not have access to the Admin Settings tab** - this is for debug, troubleshooting and fixing a server's configuration if anything goes wrong.

### Editing your settings

Here, you are able to change your Vanity URL, Banner, Server Description and Submission Retention Limit.&#x20;

Some of these options are restricted for free users, however most of these are niche or often not required for everyday users.

### Introduction to Permissions

Using the dropdown for selecting roles, you're able to select which roles get what permissions.

For what permissions pair with each other, and which requires another permission are listed within the Permissions documentation page.
